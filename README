xml2json

Incredibly simple xml-to-json conversion utility written in Java just to demonstrate how it can be done.

To build the file, simply type `make` (assumes you have a Java 8 or later JDK's bin directory on your path).
It will build `xml2json.class` from `src/xml2json.java` and will also convert a sample XML file (a verbose GC log
generated by Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM running this program :) ) provided in `gclog.sample` into `gclog.json`.

The very simple Makefile shows the command to compile the program and how to run the program.

Have fun!
